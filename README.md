# github-project-MAGD-ACal

This is a project including three of my previous p5.js assignments and descriptions of what each of them do.

## Lab Assignment Six

Lab Assignment Six was a project inspired by the game snake.
The player uses WASD to control the snake and move it towards the red circles to grow the length of the snake.
By using the "Toggle Mouse Mode" button on the bottom, the player can choose to control the snake with the mouse instead of WASD.
There is no way to win or lose, and instead, the project is just a demonstration of how arrays can be used to add length to the body of the snake.

## Lab Assignment Eight

Lab Assignment Eight was a simple game created to demonstrate the usage of transparent PNGs, GIFs, and different formattings and stylizations of text in p5js.
The gameplay involves the user dragging their mouse to the heart PNG and pressing it.
As the mouse approaches the heart the two JPGs of cats will approach one another.
When the user clicks on the heart, the two JPGs will overlap and a gif of hearts will appear above them.
